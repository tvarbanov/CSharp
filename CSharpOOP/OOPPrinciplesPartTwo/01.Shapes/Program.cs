/*Define abstract class Shape with only one abstract method CalculateSurface() and fields width and height. 
 * Define two new classes Triangle and Rectangle that implement the virtual method and return the surface of the figure 
 * (height*width for rectangle and height*width/2 for triangle). Define class Circle and suitable constructor so that at 
 * initialization height must be kept equal to width and implement the CalculateSurface() method. Write a program that tests 
 * the behavior of  the CalculateSurface() method for different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) stored in an array.*/
