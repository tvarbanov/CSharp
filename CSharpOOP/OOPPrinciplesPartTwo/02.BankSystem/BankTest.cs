/*A bank holds different types of accounts for its customers: deposit accounts, loan accounts and mortgage accounts. 
 * Customers could be individuals or companies.All accounts have customer, balance and interest rate (monthly based). 
 * Deposit accounts are allowed to deposit and with draw money. Loan and mortgage accounts can only deposit money.
 * All accounts can calculate their interest amount for a given period (in months). In the common case its is calculated
 * as follows: number_of_months * interest_rate.Loan accounts have no interest for the first 3 months if are held by 
 * individuals and for the first 2 months if are held by a company. Deposit accounts have no interest if their balance
 * is positive and less than 1000. Mortgage accounts have ½ interest for the first 12 months for companies and no interest
 * for the first 6 months for individuals. Your task is to write a program to model the bank system by classes and 
 * interfaces. You should identify the classes, interfaces, base classes and abstract actions and implement the 
 * calculation of the interest functionality through overridden methods.
